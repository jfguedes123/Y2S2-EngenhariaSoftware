### Retrospetiva 2

#### Start: 
We're going to start working on the F1 race calendar, as it was for this iteration but left behind. We're also going to start formatting the new page, and create the bottom navigation start.

#### Stop:
There's nothing in our current development that needs stopping.

#### Continue:
We should continue to work on our app's presentation (UI).

#### Doubts:
A lot of our doubts are: how to format very specific UI/Graphic decisions. So, they're mainly related to the programming language and its functionalities.

### Retrospetiva 3

#### Start: 
We need to start doing the final touches on the app, mainly user-friendly functions for it to flow and work better.

#### Stop:
There isn't anything that we need to stop doing.

#### Continue:
We should continue splitting our work amongst ourselves.

#### Doubts:
No doubts.

### Retrospetiva 4

We worked well together, the project was properly managed throughout its development and divided amongst its members. Everyone did what they were assigned to do.
