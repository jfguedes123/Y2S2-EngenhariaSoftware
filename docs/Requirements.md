## Requirements

### Domain model

The user must create an account with an emai and password. The initial UI will be that login page. Then, the first thing they see is the main page with the F1 logo and a navbar to select which page to go to. They have the news page, where they'll be able to access the latest news in the F1 world. The current race results, where the user will see what position the drivers ended up in, it updates after the race is over. The driver standings provide the current (and past) results of where the drivers are currently at (or ended). The circuits page shows the circuit that the F1 season will take place in, clicking on one of them will show the result of that race. The constructor standings serves the same purpose as the driver's one but for the teams.
