* [Requirements](docs/Requirements.md)
  * [User stories](docs/Requirements.md#User-stories)
  * [Domain model](docs/Requirements.md#Domain-model)
* [Architecture and Design](docs/Architecture&Design.md)
  * [Logical architecture](docs/Architecture&Design.md#logical-architecture)
  * [Physical architecture](docs/Architecture&Design.md#physical-architecture)
  * [Vertical prototype](docs/Architecture&Design.md#vertical-prototype)
* [Implementation]
* [Test]
* [Configuration and change management]
